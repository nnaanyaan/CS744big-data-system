# Movie-Recommender-System

## Overview
In this project, I built a movie recommender system based on Item Collaborative Filtering using Hadoop MapReduce in Java.


## Data
Data comes from the training dataset of Netflix Prize Challenge. The following is the information from its README.

#### Training dataset file description

The file "training_set.tar" is a tar of a directory containing 17770 files, one
per movie.  The first line of each file contains the movie id followed by a
colon.  Each subsequent line in the file corresponds to a rating from a customer
and its date in the following format:

CustomerID,Rating,Date

- MovieIDs range from 1 to 17770 sequentially.
- CustomerIDs range from 1 to 2649429, with gaps. There are 480189 users.
- Ratings are on a five star (integral) scale from 1 to 5.
- Dates have the format YYYY-MM-DD.

#### Data preprocessing

I preprocessed the original dataset in two steps:

Processing the data in each movie file into the following format: UserID, MovieID, Rating.
Merge 17770 movie files into one big input file since Hadoop is not good for dealing with lots of small files. 
And the big input file is the input of our recommender system. (apply Mapper-Join in MapReduce to solve the Out-of-Memory problem caused by the huge movie co-occurrence matrix.)


## Building Steps

* Divide data by user id
* Build co-occurrence matrix
* Normalize the co-occurrence matrix
* Build rating matrix
* Multiply co-occurrence matrix and rating matrix
* Generate recommendation list


## How to run

```
$hadoop com.sun.tools.javac.Main *.java
$jar cf recommender.jar *.class
$hadoop jar recommender.jar Driver /input /dataDividedByUser /coOccurrenceMatrix /normalizedMatrix /multiplicationMapperJoin /multiplicationSum /recommender
```
