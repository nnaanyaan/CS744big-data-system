The paper presents a computational model for the task which is efficient processing on large graphs(billions of vertices, trillions of edges).
Programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations, in the iteration, a vertice receive messages and send messgae to other vertices and modify its own state.
The model has the properties including effiency, scalable and fault-tolerant implementation on clusters of thousand of commodity computers. Its implied synchronicity makes reasoning about program easier.
