Summary:Propose a parameter sever framework for distributed machine learning problem.
It is a framework manages asynchronous data communication between nodes.
First, need to demonstrate the scalability of the the framework.
To illustrate "learning tasks are often performed in a unreliable cloud environment".(three months experiment from a company here)
------
Flexible consistency models:Our parameter server provides five key features:1.Efficient communication 2.Flexible consistency models
3.Elastic Scalability.4.Fault Tolerance and Durability 5.Ease of Use
 Engineering Challenges1.Communication2.Fault tolerance
 Related Work-YahooLDA-Distbelief-GraphLab/. In a sense, a core goal of theparameter server framework is to capture the benefits ofGraphLabâ€™s asynchrony without its structural limitations.
feature-extraction, the objective function, and learning.
To motivate the design decisions in our system, next we briefly outline the two widely used machine learning
technologies that we will use to demonstrate the efficacy
of our parameter server.
Risk Minimization
The most expensive step in Algorithm 1 is computing
the subgradient to update w.
